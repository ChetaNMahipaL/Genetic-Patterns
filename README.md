## Abstract
Genetics research has witnessed an explosion of data in recent years, requiring advanced analytical approaches to extract meaningful insights. This project leverages matrix operations, eigenvalue analysis, and dimensionality reduction techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of gene interactions, disease susceptibility, and evolutionary processes. The project underscores the significance of linear algebra as a powerful tool for analyzing genetic data and provides a foundation for future investigations in the field of genetics research.

## Problem Statement
The project focuses on determining the long-term distribution of genotypes in a population of plants with three possible genotypes: AA, Aa, and aa. The project formulates the problem using matrix notation and applies concepts from linear algebra to analyze the steady-state distribution of genotypes in the population.

## Key Concepts
- Alleles and Genotypes
- Autosomal Inheritance
- Punnett Tables
- Hardy-Weinberg Law
- Matrix Notation
- Transition Matrix
- Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
- Diagonalization

## Python Code
The repository also includes Python code for faster computation and data visualization related to the project. You can find the code and usage examples in the [Python Code](link-to-code-file) file.

## Data Visualization
The data visualization section provides graphical representation of probability dynamics in the population. You can view the visualization in the [Data Visualization](link-to-visualization-file) file.

## Use of Linear Algebra
The project demonstrates how linear algebra plays a crucial role in understanding and analyzing genetic phenomena. It provides powerful tools for studying the relationships between alleles, genotypes, and phenotypes in populations.

## Conclusion
As genetics advances, the integration of linear algebraic techniques will become even more significant, enabling us to extract insights from vast datasets, uncover genetic patterns, and make predictions about genes and populations. Linear algebra will continue to be essential for modeling and understanding the intricate relationships in genetics, driving discoveries and advancements in the field.
